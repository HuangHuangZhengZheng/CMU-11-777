# Lec 1.2: Multimodal Research Tasks

## Course syllabus and projects assignments

tasks:
- after reading the paper, created a short summary of the paper to help others
- read other's summaries, ask questions
- write *follow-up* posts comparing the papers and suggesting ideas, at least one!

it is ok to be worse than the baseline, as long as you can figure out *why*
