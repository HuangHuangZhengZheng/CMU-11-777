## what is multimodal?

more abstract, the close those features will be :thinking:, Abstract modalities are more likely to be homogeneous

In short, multimodal is the science of **heterogeneous** and **interconnected** data.

### dimensions of heterogeneity

- elem wise: a image can be seemed as a *list* of objects
- elem distribution: density, frequency
- structure: temporal, spatial, hierarchical, latent, explicit ...
- information: abstraction (eg, describe the whole room in a few words), entropy
- noise: uncertainty, signal-to-noise ratio (like typos), missing data 
- relevance: task relevance, context dependence; maybe two modalities are not relevant to each other, and their tasks are not related

### Interconnectedness
